# DiceCT scanning snakes

This repository contains the code used to plot regressions and grayscale values.
The R-script was run on a local machine where the grayscale values were stored (extracted from diceCT scans of snakes in VG studio).

The 'plots' directory contains the resulting figures output by the Rscript.

The 'data' directory contains a specimen list (.csv) with information on taxanomy, size, staining duration and museum information. 
This directory also contains a directory with the grawyscale values (.csv) for each specimen.

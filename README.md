# DiceCT scanning snakes

This repository contains the code used to plot regressions of iodine staining duration over specimen size, and plot grayscale values (extracted from diceCT scans of snakes).

The R-script was run on a local machine where the grayscale values were stored.

The 'data' directory contains a specimen list (.csv) with information on taxanomy, size, staining duration and museum information. 
This directory also contains a directory with the grayscale values (.csv) for each specimen.

The 'plots' directory contains the resulting figures output by the Rscript.
